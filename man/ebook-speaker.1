.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBeBook-speaker\fP reads aloud eBooks and other text formats and even scanned documents using a software speech-synthesizer. By default the tool espeak is used for speech output.
\fBeBook-speaker\fP also can scan a documant by itself using the scanimage application.
.PP
A list of items on the eBook will appear. Press <ENTER> to start reading. When reading of an item has finished, \fBeBook-speaker\fP will read the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.
