NAME

SYNOPSIS

DESCRIPTION
eBook-speaker reads the specified eBook_file and uses espeak for output.

A list of items on the eBook will appear. Press <ENTER> to start playing. When reading of an item has finished, eBook-speaker will play the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.

OPTIONS
eBook_file  Give an eBook_file as argument to eBook-speaker. Currently the EPUB format and the Microsoft Reader eBook format (lit) are supported.
-l language  eBook-speaker tries to detect the language of the specified eBook. With this option the detected language can be overridden. By some eBooks this option is mandatory.
SCREEN
The name and version of this program and the name of the author will be displayed left aligned at the top of the screen. The name of the current loaded book will be displayed right aligned.

The next rows will display the title of the item, the first page of the item within brackets (if there are pages) and the total number of phrases in this item.
