eBook-speaker - read aloud eBooks and other text formats using a software speech-synthesizer
SYNOPSIS
eBook-speaker [eBook_file | -s] [-d ALSA_sound_device] [-t TTS_command]
DESCRIPTION
eBook-speaker reads aloud eBooks and other text formats and even scanned documents using a software speech-synthesizer. By default the tool espeak is used for speech output.
eBook-speaker also can scan a documant by itself using the scanimage application.

A list of items on the eBook will appear. Press <ENTER> to start reading. When reading of an item has finished, eBook-speaker will read the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.
OPTIONS

SCREEN
The name and version of this program and the name of the author is displayed left aligned at the top of the screen. The name of the current loaded book is displayed right aligned.

The second row of the screen displays the number of pages of the current loaded book (if any), the current selected level and the total number of levels, the total number of phrases and the current displayed screen and the total number of screens.

The spoken phrase will be displayed on the bottom-line of the screen, so one can follow along on a braille-terminal what he hears.

The next rows displays the title of the item, the first page of the item within brackets (if there are pages) and the total number of phrases in this item. Items in higher levels are indented. (Three spaces each level.) When "just reading this item" is active, a "J" is viewed at the first column of that item.
