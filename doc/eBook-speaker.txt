NAME
eBook-speaker - read aloud eBooks and other text formats using a software speech-synthesizer

SYNOPSIS
eBook-speaker [eBook_file | -s [-r resolution]] [-o language-code] [-h] [-i] [-d ALSA_sound_device] [-t TTS_command] [-b n | y] [-c]

DESCRIPTION
eBook-speaker reads aloud eBooks and other text formats and even scanned documents using a software speech-synthesizer. By default the tool espeak is used for speech output.
eBook-speaker also can scan a documant by itself using the scanimage application.

A list of items on the eBook will appear. Press <ENTER> to start reading. When reading of an item has finished, eBook-speaker will read the next item and the cursor will automatically skip to that item, so that an attached braille-terminal will display the name of that item.

  When no input-file is supplied, eBook-speaker will bring up a file-manager. See KEYBOARD COMMANDS IN THE FILEMANAGER.

-b n | y  Set the initial break_on_EOL. After quiting eBook-speaker. this setting will be saved and used as default for future books. It can be overruled with the 'b'-command for each individual book. See the 'b' command.

-c  eBook-speaker use tesseract for OCR by default. This option forces eBook-speaker to use cuneiform instead.

-d ALSA_sound_device  eBook-speaker will play on this sound device. Default is "hw:0". This option overrules the value in the ~/.eBook-speaker.xml config file.

-h  Print this usage message.

-i  Ignore reading of the bookmark.

-l  Deprecated. eBook-speaker now determines the file-type using the libmagic library.

-o language-code  The language code for OCR to use. (typically an ISO 639-1 two-letter code. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes>). If this option not is specified. the language is determined according to the current locale.

-r resolution  By default the option "-s" will scan at a resolution of 400  DPI. With this option one can force another resolution.

-s  Scan a document using a hardware scanner and OCR it with either tesseract or cuneiform.

-t TTS-command  Be sure that the TTS reads from the file eBook-speaker.txt and that it writes to the file eBook-speaker.wav.

Examples:

- eBook-speaker some.epub -t "espeak -f eBook-speaker.txt -w eBook-speaker.wav -v nl"

- eBook-speaker some.epub -t "flite eBook-speaker.txt eBook-speaker.wav"

- eBook-speaker some.epub -t "text2wave eBook-speaker.txt -o eBook-speaker.wav"

SCREEN
The name and version of this program and the name of the author is displayed left aligned at the top of the screen. The name of the current loaded book is displayed right aligned.

The second row of the screen displays the number of pages of the current loaded book (if any), the current selected level and the total number of levels, the total number of phrases and the current displayed screen and the total number of screens.

The spoken phrase will be displayed on the bottom-line of the screen, so one can follow along on a braille-terminal what he/she hears.

The next rows displays the title of the item, the first page of the item within brackets (if there are pages) and the total number of phrases in this item. Items in higher levels are indented. (Three spaces each level.) When "just reading this item" is active, a "J" is viewed at the first column of that item.

- Choose one by moving the cursor with the cursor-keys and select it by pressing the ENTER-key.

- To delete a TTS-command press the DEL-key.

- A new TTS-command can be provided by adding the TTS-command to the TTS-line.

- To edit an existing TTS-command one has to edit the ~/.eBook-speaker.xml file by hand.

Be sure that the new TTS reads its information from the file eBook-speaker.txt and that it writes to the file eBook-speaker.wav.
