1.0	This source is a modification of daisy-player.
1.1	Display the number of phrases in an item.
	When an item is playing, display the number of the currently
	spoken phrase and the number of the phrases not read yet.
1.2	Previous versions of eBook-speaker ran  too ropy.
	While running, the eBook file was constantly reread.
	From this version on, the eBook is first read into a struct
	and the struct is read while running. this makes it react
	much smoother on keyboard commands.
	Remove bookmark when reading is finished.
2.0	Added support for Microsoft Reader eBook (lit) books.
2.1	I dropped the use of libzip. .epub will be unzipped using
	the unzip utility.
2.2	Removed my own xml parser in favour of libxml2.
	XML toolkit from the GNOME project

	The following files are not needed anymore:
	   UCkd.h
	   UCkd.txt
	   entities.h
	   entities.txt

	eBook-speaker uses calibre, lowriter, pandoc, pdftohtml,
	scanimage, html2, 2html and ocrfeeder internally
	Added the 't' command to popup a TTS-selector.
2.3	Re-organizes the texts. eBook-speaker puts a break after each
	'.', ',', '!', '?', ':' or ';'. The result is, that there
	will be much more phrases, so that reading is smoother.
2.3.1
	The file .eBook-speaker.rc is not needed anymore.
	Little bugs fixed
2.3.3	The function realname() is not needed anymore
2.4	ocrfeeder is replaced by tesseract
	error.wav is not longer used.
	An argument now is optional.
	When no argument is given on the command-line, a file-manager
	will appear..
2.4.1	Control-key B in file-manager to move cursor to last file/item.
	Control-key T in file-manager to move cursor to first file/item.
	The file-manager will first fill an array with filenames and
	their magic info, so that it reacts smoother.
2.5	Memory bug solved - eBook speaker took increasingly more memory.
	View total phrases on the status-line.
	Bookmarks written when killed with "killall". (SIGTERM)
	Switch hidden files displaying on/off in directory listing.
