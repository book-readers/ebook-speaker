1.0	This source is a modification of daisy-player.
1.1	Display the number of phrases in an item.
	When an item is playing, display the number of the currently
	spoken phrase and the number of the phrases not read yet.
1.2	Previous versions of eBook-speaker ran  too ropy.
	While running, the eBook file was constantly reread.
	From this version on, the eBook is first read into a struct
	and the struct is read while running. this makes it react
	much smoother on keyboard commands.
	Remove bookmark when reading is finished.
2.0	Added support for Microsoft Reader eBook (lit) books.
2.1	I dropped the use of libzip. .epub will be unzipped using
	the unzip utility.
2.2	Removed my own xml parser in favour of libxml2.
	XML toolkit from the GNOME project

	The following files are not needed anymore:
	   UCkd.h
	   UCkd.txt
	   entities.h
	   entities.txt

	eBook-speaker uses calibre, lowriter, pandoc, pdftohtml,
	scanimage, html2, 2html and ocrfeeder internally
	Added the 't' command to popup a TTS-selector.
2.3	Re-organizes the texts. eBook-speaker puts a break after each
	'.', ',', '!', '?', ':' or ';'. The result is, that there
	will be much more phrases, so that reading is smoother.

	'T' in file-manager to move cursor to first file/item.

	+   setlocale (LC_NUMERIC, "C"); added to force a decimal point
	independently of the used language.
2.7	The spoken phrase will now be displayed on the bottom-line of the

	he hears.

	passed on to the TTS used for better speech.
