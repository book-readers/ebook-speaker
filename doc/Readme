(C)2013 J. Lemmens

DESCRIPTION
eBook-speaker reads an eBook and uses a speech synthisizer for output.
eBook-speaker reads the EPUB format. If the given file is not an
EPUB it will be converted using several tools like calibre, lowriter,
pandoc, pdftohtml, scanimage, html2, 2html or tesseract.
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_e-book_formats)
eBook-speaker can use any TTS (Text-To_speech) tool, as long as the TTS
can read the text from a file and writes the audio to a .wav file.
The file ~/.eBook-speaker.xml contains TTS tools to use.
