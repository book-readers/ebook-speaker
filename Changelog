1.0	This source is a modification of daisy-player.
1.1	Display the number of phrases in an item.
	When an item is playing, display the number of the currently
	spoken phrase and the number of the phrases not read yet.
1.2	Previous versions of eBook-speaker ran  too ropy.
	While running, the eBook file was constantly reread.
	From this version on, the eBook is first read into a struct
	and the struct is read while running. this makes it react
	much smoother on keyboard commands.
